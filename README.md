# User Story

Imagine you recently discovered a new YouTube channel about "INSERT TOPIC" you really enjoyed. After clicking through some of the channels the YouTuber suggested to you, you found another YouTube channel covering a similar topic. 
You can use our tool to discover more channels with content you might be interested in. Our tool gathers all YouTube channels, starting with the one you discovered, that link one another. We display the gathered data in form of a horizontal tree. With each YouTube channel represented by a vertex of the tree and each edge representing a connection between two YouTubers that link one another. 

You can explore the dataset by assigning markers to YouTube channels you are interested in. The application then performs a search in the tree to highlight all channels that are related to the selected YouTuber. If you set a marker on both of the channels you discovered manually, the application highlights channels that are related to both of the marked YouTubers. These channels are the ones that could be interesting for you. You can open the channels from inside the application in a new tab.
